# A title for a post.

That Friday we drank in SF, and caught a train to San Mateo, closed out Moons. My friend Rennie got up from the booth to sign for karaoke, and a guy sits down in her place.

I say, 'Hey buddy? How you doing?'
'Good yeah. Good.'
'Yeah alright.'

His friend walks up, says 'sorry for my friend'. I introduce myself. The friend says, 'I'm Matt and he's Nate'
guy who sat down says, 'no I'm Matt, he's Nate'.

Okay.

Real Matt says, 'it's Nate's birthday, sorry he's so drunk,' and sits down with him, at my booth I am in, and waves over their other friends. I now am a part of this birthday party.

So I, being the polite bar patron I am, asked real Nate how old he was. 'Twenty Three,' he says, he then asks me how old I am.

Well alright.

'Twenty Four' I say.

He starts to mumble about this girl who was twenty four and she said it was too much age difference, too much age difference, she was too old she said.

I interrupt.

'So hows the birthday going, Nate?'

'Oh good, good,' a friend brings him another beer and some food, Rennie gets back to the table, sitting next to me instead of where she had been, where Nate is now sitting. He starts sleepily staring at the table. Rennie politely strikes up conversation with the friends who address the wall behind her as though it were speaking. Nate seeing her attention diverted leans over to me conspiratorially, gesturing between Rennie and I.

'So are you like a thing?'
'No, we're not.'
'Well thats too bad.'
'Is it?'

He leans back and gives me a weird look.

And so we hung out with Nate and Matt and Tyler and Jacob until close, cause who am I to tell Nate to leave on his birthday.
