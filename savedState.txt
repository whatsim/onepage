So I've never ran a blog long.

Blogs when they're new are the saddest things in the world, and then later you have the opposite problem of having this enormous corpus on the internet forever which, frankly, is a little intimidating. I don't want to have all the inertia to build up, and having built it up, I don't want to have to maintain it for all time.

There's been a lot of work on ephemeral internet content recently. Edna Piranha's [meatspace](http://chat.meatspac.es), a continuous and never saved chat, or my own [tearoff](http://t.clvr.cc). There's this building reaction to the concept of the internet being forever.

Now of course, anyone is free to log [meatspac.es](http://chat.meatspac.es), or this site even, to their hearts content. I'm not claiming any protection or anonymity. I understand I'm putting it on the internet and the internet never forgets. I just don't want the burden of maintaining an ever more complex digital life. I want posting stuff on the internet to be fun again. I don't want to think about updating some huge blog every 6 months as the net continues to change. Really, just the thought of my responsibility to maintain things on the internet for forever stops me from posting.

So this is a punt on that.

I do sometimes want to write something or share some pictures, or who knows what else. But I won't maintain it. If you see something you like, you should save it. The instant I want to post or share something else, the old content is gone. Thats the deal.

**One Page ever.**

In my continuing quest to be a better internet citizen, I'm put the code up for this at [github](https://github.com/whatsim/onepage). Fair warning, I mostly scavenged the parts in an afternoon from other things I've written. Its not that tidy in there.

So yeah, we'll have to see if this solves the problem and gets me to a point where I want to put stuff publicly on the internet again. 

We'll see I guess.
